<p align="center" style="font-style: italic;">My SoP for UMD (you can zoom-in the picture)</p>
</p>

**Accepted:** UMD, MILA, UPitt, RiceU (unofficial)

**Rejected:** Harvard, JHU, UMass

### Few advice:

- The whole grad school application process is highly stochastic, so if you get rejected, don't take it too harshly.
- I believe LoR plays one of the most important roles, so try finding people who can vouch for you and say some really good words. If they're famous people in your field, then that's even better.
- Make your SoP read by a ton of people. Basically, with every feedback that you recieve, your SoP keeps getting better and better. You'll see that after a month or two, the look and sound of your SoP has changed a lot and if that happens, I'd say you're making progress.
